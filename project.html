        <h2>Project 1: Nutribite - Safety Culture Hackathon</h2>
        <p>Within groups of 3-4, we were tasked to come up with an AI solution to any problem we wanted to work with. My group and I decided to target the new trend within society - a rise in health-conscious living and the increasing demand for personalised wellness solutions. We created "Nutribite" - an Android mobile app that allows users to input their health information (i.e. height, weight, health goals, allergies etc) and scan an image of a packaged food product which returns a recommendation on whether the users should consume the food or not, based on their target goals. Specfically, my role was to work on the backend, and find a way to use the AWS AI model APIs’ (Textract) and connect this with our backend server as well as the OpenAI model (which another team member worked on). This experience allowed me to gain a massive amount of knowledge regarding AWS, APIs, and the GO language.</p>
        <br>
        <li>Achieved "Most Technically Impressive Project" Award for Nutribite</li>

        <h2>Project 1: Arduino Rover Maze Challenge</h2>
        <p>This was a group project, where I worked with 2 other software engineering students to use C, assembly language and Arduinos to make an Arduino rover move through a maze. This project enabled me to understand the connection between Software and Hardware. My role was to contribute to the development of the code, specifically to handle rover senses. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Accessed the rover sensor data and ensured that the rover stopped moving when it was too close to a maze wall</li>
            <li>Implement a 3-point turn on the rover to successfully navigate through maze</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
        <p>Through multiple testing and code modifications, we came to a conclusion that “Follow the left wall” algorithm would be the most successful code implementation to navigate the maze. In the end, our code won the fastest-time across all the other groups in this course!</p>

        <h2>Project 2: R Statistical Analysis</h2>
        <p>I conducted comprehensive data analysis using R, exploring Housing Arrangements in LGAs and Bowel Cancer datasets. Through specific statistical tests and visualisations, I derived insights, formulated hypotheses, and contextualised findings with additional research. The results were compiled into professional reports, showcasing proficiency in data analysis, statistical testing, and report writing.</p>

        <h2>Project 4: Predicting PCOS in Women</h2>
        <p>This was a group project, where I worked with 3 other engineers (from Mechatronic and Biomedical background) to use Machine Learning Models to predict PCOS Presence in Women using a dataset from Kaggle. We have successfully created an algorithm in python which merges the prediction of 5 ML models (we chose the top 5 by accuracy from a group of 8 models we worked with) to give a final output of whether or not PCOS is present. As a Software Engineering student, I had the most experience with coding out of all our members. Therefore I was chosen to be the key developer for this project whilst overseeing the coding components of all the other members.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Coordinated the integration of Gaussian Naive Bayes, KNN, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Regression, and Random Forest models to enhance prediction accuracy.</li>
          <li>Conducted rigorous testing with various parameters to validate model performance and optimise results.</li>
          <li>Authored a comprehensive project report outlining methodologies, findings, and insights.</li>

        <p>The project aimed to practice neural network knowledge by building a pipeline for fruit classification. The task involved building a fruit classification pipeline using various neural network architectures. After experimenting with various CNN architectures such as AlexNet, DenseNet, and ResNet, I found that AlexNet yielded the best results, achieving a final accuracy of 98.95%.</p>
