        <h2>Project 1: Gluttonous Snake Game</h2>
        <p>This was a group project with 4 other team members, where we were given an initial template and had to create a Gluttonous Snake game using Python. As a group, we had to strictly follow the software development process (SDLC). My role was to contribute to the development of the code, create visual and graphic assets, and produce a wireframe.</p>

        <h2>Project 2: Hangman Game</h2>
        <p>Following on from the last project, alongside the same team members, our task was to create a hangman game (in python) from a given specification. Again, we had to follow the SDLC process, however this time we had to follow an agile approach, where we had to run through an SDLC process multiple times. My role in this project was to write and stimulate test cases (as the main software tester), create graphic assets and produce UML diagrams for each SDLC cycle.</p>

        <h2>Project 3: Chess Game</h2>
        <p>Currently, I am actively involved in the development of an XXLChess game using the Java programming language. This individual project is an exciting opportunity for me to apply my skills and knowledge in software development while working on a complex and strategic game.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Utilising the PApplet processing library combined with Gradle</li>
          <li>Creating Testcase reports using JUnit and Jacoco</li>
          <li>Actively ensuring that code follows appropriate Object Oriented Design</li>
          <li>Producing UMLs for my code</li>

        <h2>Project 4: Predicting PCOS in Women</h2>
        <p>This was a group project, where I worked with 3 other engineers (from Mechatronic and Biomedical background) to use Machine Learning Models to predict PCOS Presence in Women using a dataset from Kaggle. We have successfully created an algorithm in python which merges the prediction of 5 ML models (we chose the top 5 by accuracy from a group of 8 models we worked with) to give a final output of whether or not PCOS is present. As a Software Engineering student, I had the most experience with coding out of all our members. Therefore I was chosen to be the key developer for this project whilst overseeing the coding components of all the other members.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Specifically worked with the Gaussian Naive Bayes, KNN, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest ML models</li>
          <li>Executed testing with various random states and test sizes across our models</li>
          <li>Responsible for writing a comprehensive and insightful project report</li>

        <h2>Project 5: Arduino Rover Maze Challenge</h2>
        <p>This was a group project, where I worked with 2 other software engineering students to use C, assembly language and Arduinos to make an Arduino rover move through a maze. This project enabled me to understand the connection between Software and Hardware. My role was to contribute to the development of the code, specifically to handle rover senses. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Accessed the rover sensor data and ensured that the rover stopped moving when it was too close to a maze wall</li>
            <li>Implement a 3-point turn on the rover to successfully navigate through maze</li>
            <p>  
              
            </p>
          </ul>
        <p>Through multiple testing and code modifications, we came to a conclusion that “Follow the left wall” algorithm would be the most successful code implementation to navigate the maze. In the end, our code won the fastest-time across all the other groups in this course!</p>
